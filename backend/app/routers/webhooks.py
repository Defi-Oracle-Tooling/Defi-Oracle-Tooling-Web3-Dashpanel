    # This might involve:
    # - Verifying the webhook signature (if provided by Tatum).
    # - Identifying the event type (e.g., incoming payment, account 
    #   update).
    # - Updating internal database records based on the event.
    # - Triggering actions (e.g., notifying users via WebSocket).

    #     amount = payload.get('amount')
