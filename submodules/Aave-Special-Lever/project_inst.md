Below is the complete, integrated implementation “package” that combines all of the recommended paths into one deployable project. You can create the following folder structure with all the files listed, then run the provided zip command to produce a file named combined-leverage-system.zip. This package includes:

• A main contract that integrates flash loan–enabled recursive leverage, dynamic LTV rotation (with oracle simulation), eMode layering, yield auto-routing, and a DAO-controlled emergency exit.
• Individual modules for flash loan operations, LTV control, yield routing, and a basic DAO access control contract.
• A Hardhat testing suite that verifies basic functionality.
• A README with instructions on reviewing, customizing, deploying, and testing the implementation.

In a production environment, you should replace the dummy implementations (e.g. simulated oracle data, flash loan logic, yield routing) with actual calls to Aave protocols, Chainlink feeds, and your preferred integrations.

# Combined Leverage System

This project implements an advanced Aave v3 Toggle-Optimized Leverage system that integrates:

- **Flash Loan-Enabled Recursive Leverage:** Uses flash loans to atomically execute recursive leverage loops.
- **Dynamic LTV Rotation:** Adjusts the LTV in real time using simulated oracle data.
- **eMode Layering & Asset Isolation:** Increases borrowing capacity by grouping correlated assets.
- **Yield & Strategy Routing:** Auto-toggles collateral positions and routes yields to external protocols.
- **DAO Safety & Emergency Unwind:** Provides an emergency exit mechanism controlled by a DAO authority.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

	2.	Run Tests:

npx hardhat test


	3.	Deployment:
Deploy the contracts to your chosen network following Hardhat deployment processes.

Review & Customize
	•	Review & Customize:
The provided Solidity contracts are a simplified demonstration. For production use, integrate proper external protocol calls (such as Aave flash loan calls and Chainlink oracle feeds) and add security measures.
	•	Deploy & Test:
Use Hardhat to deploy these contracts to your testnet/mainnet. Run the tests with npx hardhat test to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
	•	Documentation & Playbook:
Use this README and in-code comments as a playbook for your team to understand the implementation details and underlying rationale for each module.

3. Packaging as a ZIP File

Once you have created the folder structure with the files above, open your terminal in the parent directory of combined-leverage-system and run the following command to generate the zip file:

zip -r combined-leverage-system.zip combined-leverage-system

This command will package the entire folder into combined-leverage-system.zip. You can then share or deploy this zip file as needed.

Final Notes
	•	Review & Customize:
Before production deployment, ensure that you replace the simulated flash loan, oracle, and yield routing logic with proper integrations (e.g., Aave flash loans, Chainlink oracles). Also, review the security measures in all contracts.
	•	Deploy & Test:
Use Hardhat to deploy the contracts to your desired testnet/mainnet and run the tests with npx hardhat test to verify functionality.
	•	Documentation & Playbook:
Use the README and in-code comments as a playbook for your development team to understand each module’s purpose and flow.
